        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am currently a student in the Khoury College of Computer Science at
          Northeastern University, San Francisco campus. I am hoping to graduate
          in 2024.<br />
          Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng in civil Engineering and AS in
          Mathematics. I am highly interested in most areas of computer science,
          with a particular interest in computer graphics such ase
          <em><strong>AR,VR, Visualization and Computer Vision.</strong></em>

<!--"Distributed systems" refer to a network of multiple computers or servers that work together to achieve a common goal. These systems are designed to distribute tasks or workload across different machines to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. In the skills section about distributed systems, you can mention the following:

Distributed Computing Concepts: Understanding the fundamental principles and concepts of distributed systems, such as scalability, fault tolerance, consistency, and concurrency control.
Distributed File Systems: Familiarity with distributed file systems like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Google File System (GFS) and their features for storing and managing large amounts of data across multiple nodes.
Distributed Database Systems: Experience with distributed databases like Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, or Amazon DynamoDB, including concepts like data partitioning, replication, consistency models, and distributed querying.
Message Queueing Systems: Knowledge of message brokers and distributed message queueing systems such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or ActiveMQ, used for asynchronous communication and decoupling of components in distributed architectures.
Distributed Computing Frameworks: Proficiency in distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or Hadoop MapReduce for processing large-scale data in parallel across a cluster of machines.
Network Protocols and Communication: Understanding of network protocols and communication patterns in distributed systems, including remote procedure calls (RPC), message-passing interfaces (MPI), and protocols like TCP/IP or UDP.
Consensus Algorithms: Familiarity with consensus algorithms such as Paxos, Raft, or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), which ensure agreement among distributed nodes and handle failures and inconsistencies.
Fault Tolerance and Replication: Knowledge of techniques for fault tolerance, data replication, and consistency models in distributed systems, including mechanisms like replication protocols, leader-election algorithms, and data consistency models (e.g., eventual consistency, strong consistency).
Cloud Computing and Microservices: Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure) and designing microservices architectures, including service discovery, load balancing, and scalability in distributed environments.
Performance Monitoring and Troubleshooting: Skills in monitoring and analyzing the performance of distributed systems, identifying bottlenecks, optimizing resource utilization, and diagnosing and resolving issues in distributed setups.

These are some key skills related to distributed systems, but the field is vast and constantly evolving. Tailor your skills section based on your specific experience, projects, and the requirements of the role you are targeting.-->
